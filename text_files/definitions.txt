KEY POINTS
- RANDOM VARIABLE : A VARIABLE OF WHICH THE VALUE DEPENDS ON A RANDOM PROCESS
- EVENT : A COLLECTION OF OUTCOMES

A random variable is a variable which can take any of a number of distinct outcomes depending on the result of a underlying random process. For example, there's a bucket with five balls in it, 3 red balls and 2 blue balls. The random variable X represents the color of a ball drawn blindly from the bucket. The distinct outcomes in this scenario are: (i) the color of the ball is red, (ii) the color of the ball is blue.
