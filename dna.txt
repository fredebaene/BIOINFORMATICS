validate_sequence(sequence)
---------------------------

A string can be considered a valid representation of a DNA sequence if and only if all of the characters in the string are one of the following characters :

- A : adenine
- C : cytosine
- G : guanine
- T : thymine.

The function returns a boolean value :

- TRUE : the given string is a valid representation of a DNA sequence
- FALSE : the given string is not a valid representation of a DNA sequence.

calculate_sequence_length(sequence)
-----------------------------------

The length of a DNA sequence is expressed as the number of nucleotides (or the number of base pairs) it consists out of. A base pair consists out of two nucleotides from different DNA strands bonded together via its bases. The function calculates the length of a given DNA sequence if and only if the DNA sequence is valid.

When the given string is not a valid representation of a DNA sequence, the function will return an error message : "Please enter a valid DNA sequence". When the given string is a valid representation of a DNA sequence, the function will return an integer representing the length of the DNA sequence expressed as the number of nucleotides it consists out of.

calculate_nucleotide_occurrences(sequence)
------------------------------------------

A DNA sequence is an ordered collection of nucleotides. This function calculates the occurrence rate of each of the four possible nucleotides (A, C, G, T) in a given DNA sequence if and only if the given string is a valid representation of a DNA sequence.

When the given string is not a valid representation of a DNA sequence, the function will return an error message : "Please enter a valid DNA sequence". When the given string is a valid representation of a DNA sequence, the function will return a dictionary of the form {"A" : a, "C" : c, "G" : g, "T" : t}, in which a, c, g, and t each represent the occurrence rate of the nucleotides A, C, G, and T, respectively.

output_nucleotide_occurrences(sequence)
---------------------------------------

This function prints the nucleotide occurrence rates of a given DNA sequence as follows : a c g t.

calculate_hamming_distance(sequence_a, sequence_b)
--------------------------------------------------

Given two valid DNA sequences of the same length, the hamming distance is the number of nucleobases in which these two DNA sequences differ at their respective position.

For example :
- sequence_a = "ACATTACAG"
- sequence_b = "AGATTACAG"

These two DNA sequences only differ in their nucleobases at the second nucleotide, in sequence_a it is "C", and in sequence_b it is "G". In this case, the hamming distance is 1.

The return value of this function is an integer indicating the hamming distance between two DNA sequences of equal length.
