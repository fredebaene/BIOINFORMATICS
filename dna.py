A DNA sequence is valid if and only if it contains zero or more of the following nucleotides :

    - ADENINE (A)
    - CYTOSINE (C)

The following function checks if the nucleotides in a given DNA sequence are no other than the ones mentioned above :

- if the sequence is valid, then the return value is TRUE
- if the sequence is not valid, then the return value is FALSE.

The length of a DNA sequence is expressed as the number of nucleotides (or the number of base pairs). A base pair consists out of two nucleotides bonded together via its bases.
